# Hospital Management System

I developed this system as a Database Systems' course project of my Bachelors degree which displays Doctors' information and stores patients' information for an appointment. There is also a facility of online report checkup. The frontend part of the system was built using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the robust backend was programmed using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.
